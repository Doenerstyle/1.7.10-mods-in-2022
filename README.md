# 1.7.10 Mods in 2022

Although it's [been some time](https://howoldisminecraft1710.today) since the release of Minecraft 1.7.10, there are still [new mods being uploaded for it every week](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods?filter-game-version=1738749986%3A5&filter-sort=1).

As some resources are not available anymore and relatively few people are talking about mods for versions as old as 1.7.10, this guide aims to provide you with information, resources, links, and tips about modding in Minecraft 1.7.10 in 2022. **If you find anything inaccurate or know something that seems like it belongs here, you're welcome to open an issue or create a pull request!**

# Missing/not automatically downloadable resources

Here you can find hints and downloads for resources that were usually downloaded automatically, but nowadays can't be.

### iChun's [Hats mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hats)

iChun's Hats mod loads its hats from the contents of *.minecraft/hats*. Unfortunately, the automated download is no longer working - preventing the mod from actually having any usable hats.

The directory including all of the hats can be downloaded from this repo [**here**](https://github.com/Doenerstyle/1.7.10-mods-in-2022/raw/main/hats.zip). Simply put the *hats* folder from inside the archive into the main *.minecraft* directory.

**Tip**: If you don't want the mod to add a specific hat, you can easily remove the according file(s) from that directory.

### iChun's [Portal Gun mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/portal-gun)

iChun's Portal Gun mod loads its sound assets/files from the file *.minecraft/mods/PortalGunSounds.pak*. This file's download has not been working for several years now.

The file can be downloaded from this repo [**here**](https://github.com/Doenerstyle/1.7.10-mods-in-2022/raw/main/PortalGunSounds.pak). Simply put the file into the *mods* directory.

### Missing anything?

If you're missing mod-related files that would automatically be downloaded before, consider opening an issue on this repo! Chances are that somebody still has them or knows a modpack that does.

# Updating mods is important, even in 1.7.10!

If you're creating a 1.7.10 modpack, rather than testing out some mods every now and then, you should definitely consider to check for mod updates *somewhat* regularly, e. g. every 12 months. **And if you haven't checked before, you should do so right now!** (Also, make sure you're using the latest version of Forge, which was released in 2015.)

Although very most popular mods* have moved past 1.7.10 or been discontinued, there is still a realistic chance of single mods being updated, such as [BuildCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/buildcraft), which has received an update of its 1.7.10 version [in November 2021](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/buildcraft/files/all?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A4449).

Of course, these will mostly be bugfix updates - but eliminating long-standing bugs surely is worth the little extra time it takes to update a mod in your modpack, right?

On another note: As multiple years have passed since most updates have been released, it should be relatively safe to use alpha and beta versions. Reading through the mod's comments on CurseForge will usually tell you if there are major problems concering a latest release. However, being alert if the changelog explicitly states things such as "This version is still very unstable and might break/corrupt things" should be a good practice. Always consider how risky an alpha or beta version *might* be.

*An honorable mention to be added here are [Xaero's Minimap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap) and [Xaero's World Map](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-world-map), which are both still being actively maintained and optimized for 1.7.10, with usually at least 1-2 updates a month. This awesome support also applies to all major versions *after* 1.7.10.
